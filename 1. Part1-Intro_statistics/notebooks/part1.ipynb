    "\n",
    "- Statistical modelling is a method of mathematically approximating the world. Statistical models contain variables that can be used to explain relationships between other variables. We use hypothesis testing, confidence intervals etc to make inferences and validate our hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simply, we use machine learning to make predictions and we can assess its performance by how well it generalizes to new data that is has not learned yet.\n",

    "- A population often consists of a large group of specifically defined elements. For example, the population of a specific country means all the people living within the boundaries of that country.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Usually, it is not possible or practical to measure data for every element of the population under study. We randomly select a small group of elements from the population and call it a sample. Inferences about the population are then made on the basis of several samples."
